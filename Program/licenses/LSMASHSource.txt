Linking Avisynth statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on Avisynth.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of Avisynth give you
permission to link Avisynth with independent modules that communicate with
Avisynth solely through the interfaces defined in avisynth.h, regardless of the license
terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
the source code of Avisynth (the version of Avisynth used to produce the
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a module
which is not derived from or based on Avisynth, such as 3rd-party filters,
import and export plugins, or graphical user interfaces.
